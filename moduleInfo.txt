[System] Gradient Coil System
The Gradient Coil System provides spatial encoding in MRI, generating precise gradient magnetic fields in the X, Y, and Z directions. These fields are critical for slice selection, phase encoding, and frequency encoding during the imaging process.

[Module] Gradient Coil Manufacturing
Wind gradient coils with precise control over wire tension and spacing, using automated winding machines for consistency and accuracy. Perform intermediate testing to detect and correct any defects.
